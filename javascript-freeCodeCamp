JavaScript Basics Course (freeCodeCamp)

  

VARIABLES
to use a variable first declare it:
var myName;

next initialize the value:
myName = "Sarah";

next run the variable through the console:
console.log("My name is" + myName);
>My name is Sarah

to reassign value:
myName = "Cindy";

you cannot start variables with underscores or numbers
in multi-word variables you should capitalize every word after the first word, without spaces
you should not name variables after words that compose JS syntax, like var
variables are case sensitive

JS is a loosely typed language, meaning that you do not have to specify what data type you're using


_______________

DATA TYPES

symbols: data types whose instances are unique and immutable
immutable-- cannot be altered once it is created
how are different symbols with the same name not strictly equal?

objects: a collection of properties
properties: an association between a name or a key and a value
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = "Ford";
myCar.model = "Mustang";
console.log(myCar.make);
>Ford

_______________

NUMBERS

number++; adds one to a previous number
if ++ comes before number (++number) then number is incremented before it's logged
number--; minuses one to a previous number
+= : result is the number plus a number
ex: number = number + 5 can be written as
number += 5
also *=, /=

_______________

STRING BASICS
a string is a series of characters enclosed in single or double quotes
  
a backslash escapes the quotations of a string so the console knows you're not invoking a new string
ex : "He said \"Hi!"\";
\' single quote
\" double quote
\\ backslash
\n new line
\r carriage rwturn
\t tab
\b backspaces
\f form feed
