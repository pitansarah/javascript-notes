Storing Values with the Assignment Operator :

var : can change (be reassigned)
let : can be referred to within a specific context
const : must not change

__________________

decimals :

decimals are also referred to as 40-point numbers

__________________

escaping literal quotes :

using literal quotes inside Js Code
use a \ (backslash) before every literal quotation you are using

ex: var myStr = "\"Hi!\" she said"

when using double quotes inside of a string start and end strung with single quotes

ex : var myStr = 'a href = "a-website.com"'

if you want to use single and double quotes inside a string use backticks ` to start and end string

__________________

string immutability :

var myStr = "Jello world"; /* change J */

this won't work :
myStr[0] = "H";

this will work :
var myStr = "Hello world";

__________________

arrays :

arrays are where you can store different pieces of data together

var ourArray = ["John", 23]

you can nest arrays within arrays within another set of ssquare brackets, separating nested arrays with commas

var ourArray = [["the universe", 42], ["everything", 101010]]

you can access data in arrays by using bracket notation, more than one index value refers to data retrieved from nested arrays

var myData = ourArray[0] [1];
> 42

you can modify array data
var ourArray = [1, 2, 3];
ourArray [1] = 4;
this changes the array to
[1,4,3]

__________________

push ():

manipulate arrays by adding data into an array

ourArray = [1, 2, 3];
ourArray push([4, 5, 6]);
ourArray = [1, 2, 3 [4, 5, 6]]

__________________

pop():

this function removes the last element from an array

var ourArray = [1, 2, 3];
var removedFromOurArray = ourArray pop();
> 3
console.log(myArray);
> [1, 2]

__________________

shift():

this function removes the first element from an array

var ourArray = [1, 2, 3];
var removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift():
> 1
console.log(OurArray);
> [2,3]

__________________

unshift()

this function adds an element to the beginning an array

var ourArray = [1, 2, 3];
//ourArray shift() = [1, 2]//

ourArray unshift(4);
//ourArray = [4, 1, 2]//

__________________

functions :

function ourReusableFunction() {
console.log("Hello, World");
}

ourReusableFunction();
> Hello, World

__________________

arguments :

parameters--variables that act as placeholders for the values to be input to a function when it is called

function ourFunctionWithArgs (a, b) {
console.log(a-b);
}
the parameters are a and b

ourFunctionWithArgs (10,5);

//console.log outputs 5//

__________________

global and scope functions :

scope--the visibility of variables

variables which are defined outside of a function have global scope; they can be seen anywhere in code

__________________

STRINGS : BRACKET NOTATION

zero-based indexing: starting counting from 0, like computers do

var firstName = Sarah;
console.log(firstName[0]);
>S

get the last character:
console.log(firstName[firstName.length - 1]);
>h

get the second to last character:
console.log(firstName[firstName.length - 2]);
>a

you can't alter the letters in the string once a string has been created, but you can assign a new variable

VARIABLES
to use a variable first declare it:
var myName;

next initialize the value:
myName = "Sarah";

next run the variable through the console:
console.log("My name is" + myName);
>My name is Sarah

to reassign value:
myName = "Cindy";

you cannot start variables with underscores or numbers
in multi-word variables you should capitalize every word after the first word, without spaces
you should not name variables after words that compose JS syntax, like var
variables are case sensitive

JS is a loosely typed language, meaning that you do not have to specify what data type you're using


_______________

DATA TYPES

symbols: data types whose instances are unique and immutable
immutable-- cannot be altered once it is created
how are different symbols with the same name not strictly equal?

objects: a collection of properties
properties: an association between a name or a key and a value
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = "Ford";
myCar.model = "Mustang";
console.log(myCar.make);
>Ford

_______________

NUMBERS

number++; adds one to a previous number
if ++ comes before number (++number) then number is incremented before it's logged
number--; minuses one to a previous number
+= : result is the number plus a number
ex: number = number + 5 can be written as
number += 5
also *=, /=

_______________

STRING BASICS
a string is a series of characters enclosed in single or double quotes
  
a backslash escapes the quotations of a string so the console knows you're not invoking a new string
ex : "He said \"Hi!"\";
\' single quote
\" double quote
\\ backslash
\n new line
\r carriage rwturn
\t tab
\b backspaces
\f form feed

JAVASCRIPT ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES (BETA)

- <script src = "./script.js" </script> or 
  <link href="./styles.css" rel="stylsheet"/> can be used to save separate files

- declare a variable :

  let camperbot;

- initialization: assigning a variable

- declaration and initialization: 

  let age = 32;

- camelCase : the first letter is lower case, and the beginning of all next words is uppercase

- strings can be surrounded with double quotes, single quotes, or backticks

- document.queryselector()

  assigns itself to specific elements in HTML using the DOM 
  takes a CSS selector and returns the first CSS element that matches that selector

- place <script> element inside body and not the head 
  this prevents the script from running before browser has finishing reading HTML

- declare constants, which are variable that are not going to be reassigned

  const = 

- margins: 

  ex: 10px 50px 20px /*top, left and right, bottom*/
  ex: 10px 50px 20px 0 /*top, right, bottom, left*/

- gradients are technically images, use background-image to set them
