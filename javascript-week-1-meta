INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING

- computer program: a series of instructions that tell a computer what to do 

- programming language: a bridge that facilitates communication between computers and people

- for a computer to understand programming language, it needs to be stored in RAM--random access memory 
  on a disk in binary code--a representation of machine language in 0s and 1s
  these 0s and 1s represent electric switches 

- a computer's CPU--central processing unit--can comprehend binary

- low level languages: closer to being understood by a computer's CPU

- high level languages: ex: javascript
  languages that must be converted to binary code so that a CPU can work with them

WHY JAVASCRIPT

- javascript makes interactivity possible

- JS can be used for front-end and back-end development

- JS is the only computer language that allows direct interaction with webpages dynamically on the client-side

- JS is backwards compatible, it makes websites built in the past that still work today

- every browser has a built in Javascript engine 

- Javascript is used in almost every website
  it's used in frameworks (ex: React) 
  it's used by servers (ex: Node.js)

- JS is accessible and comes with a web development community, good for new developers

- JS skills are high in demand for careers

PROGRAMMING IN JAVASCRIPT

- browser vendors: companies that build browsers, popular ca. early 2000s
  
- with these different browsers came different discrepancies between other browsers
  
- developers had to write separate code for separate browsers, which led to compatibility issues
  
- jquery solved this problem
  jquery: a library that users could import to write code, this code worked across all browsers

- React (2011) solved many issues in creating, updating, and maintaining complex websites

- legacy code: old code found on the web

_____________________________________________________________________

WRITING YOUR FIRST JAVASCRIPT CODE

- comments, 2 types:

- single-line: //this is a single-line comment

- multi-line:  

            /*this
            is
            a
            multi-line
            comment
            */

            & 

            /*this is a multi-line comment on a single line */

- semi-colon ;
  used to clearly delimit parts of code from other parts of code
  ASI (automatic semi-colon insertion) does this for you, but its best practice to manually insert semicolons

- using developer tools in browser
  right click, click inspect
  type JS commands into Devtools console section
  if you need multiple lines of code press shift + enter to get onto the next line

- ex:
            console.log("%cHello, World", "color: blue; font-size: 40px")
            //output: Hello, World (stylized in blue with a font size of 40px)

            syntax :
            console.log("%c...", "...")
                        text   ,  style

- concatenation operator-- + , a plus symbol used to join pieces of text, or execute addition between numbers

- ex: 
            console.log("Hello " + "there, " + "World")
            is the same as
            console.log("Hello ", "there, ", "World")

- commas are included after quotation marks to concatenate

_____________________________________________________________________

VARIABLES

- variable declaration:
            
            var person;

  include semicolon after declaration

- create a person variable with an assignment operator, = :

            var person = "John"
            //check variable:
            person;
            //output: John
            
- Use JS to output "Hello John" automatically:
            
            console.log("Hello", person);
            //Hello, John

- create a greeting variable
            
            var greeting = "Hello"
            console.log(greeting, person)
            //Hello John

- variable declaration :
            
            syntax:
            var ... = "..."

- why variables are useful:
  they can be reassigned with different values
  the same code can be used to get different results

- single quotes can also be used inside parentheses 

- however double quotes are used when including items in single quotes

_____________________________________________________________________

DATA TYPES 

- coding efficiently involves knowing when to use different data types

- data: the values or information within an app

- 7 primitive data types:
            string
            number
            boolean
            null
            undefined
            bigint
            symbol

- strings and numbers:

            numbers:
            375
            
            strings:
            "Hello World"

- number data types have a limited range of values
- string data types have an unlimited range of values

- boolean:
  2 values: true and false
  useful for making decisions

- null:
  1 value, null, representing absence of value

- undefined:
  1 value, undefined, represents a variable not yet assigned a value

- bigint:
  big integer
  a data type that accomodates a greater range of numbers than the number data type

- symbol:
  a data type used as a unique identifier
  a unique and immutable data type that may be used as a key for objects

_____________________________________________________________________

OPERATORS

- operators are used to perform operations on variables and values
  operators are used to manipulate individual data items and return a result

- assignment operator, =

- arithmetic operators : 
            addition, +
            subtraction, -
            division /
            multiplication *

- comparison operators:
  compares and returns a logical value based on whether comparison is true
            greater than, >
            less than, <
            equal to, == (single = is used for assignment operator)
            not equal to, !=

- logical operators:
  used to determine whether something is true or false

- and operator, && : checks for both conditions to be true
            ex : a>5 && a<10

- or operator, || : checks for at least one condition to be true
            ex : a>5 || a>10

- not operator, ! : returns false if the result is true
            ex : !(a>5) 

- more examples:

            console.log (2+2);
            > 4
            
            console.log (2<3);
            > true
            
            console.log (2>3);
            > false
            
            console.log (10==10);
            > true

_____________________________________________________________________

NUMBERS

- numbers represent both integers and decimals

- ** represents exponentiation
            ex: 
            10**2 
            //100

- % represents the remainder after division
            ex:
            9%8 
            //1
            16%8 
            //0

- () controls the order of calculations
            ex:
            2*4+8
            //16,
            //while
            2*(4+8)
            //24

_____________________________________________________________________

STRINGS

- strings are used to represent and work with a series of characters in JS

- strings are a collection of characters enclosed in single or double quotes (delimiters)

- '' or "" : empty strings

- strings cannot break onto the next line

- single quotes can be escaped with backslashes \'
  or they can be enclosed in double quotes 

            ex:
            'It's a lovely day'
            //Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
            "It's a lovely day"
            //"It's a lovely day"
- string literal: the value inside of delimiters
  in "123" the string literal is 123

_____________________________________________________________________

BOOLEANS

- boolean data types are used used to check if a statement is true or false

- strict equality operator (===), unlike equality operator (==) checks for equality of value and type
            
            100 == "100"
            //true,
            //while
            100 === "100"
            //false, because the number 100 is not the same data type as the string "100"

_____________________________________________________________________

OPERATORS IN DEPTH

- logical and operator : &&
  both A && B must be true for statement to be true
            
            ex : 
            //check if the current time is between 9 and 5
            var currentTime = 10;
            console.log (currentTime > 9 && currentTime < 17);
            // true

- logical or operator : ||
  A or B must be true for statement to be true
            
            ex : 
            var currentTime = 10
            console.log (currentTime > 9 || currentTime < 17);
            // true

- logical not operator : !

            var petHungry = true;
            console.log (!petHungry);
            // false

- modulus operator : %

            ex : 
            //find out how many people can be seated at a table
            //there are 5 tables, 4 chairs per table

            console.log (22%4) 
            // 2, two people are left unseated

- equality operator : ==

            5 == 5 // true 
            5 == 6 // false
            
- strict equality operator : ===
  compares number and data type
            
            5 === 5 // true
            5 === "5" // false, because the string 5 is not the same as the number 5

- inequality operator : !=

            5 != 5 // false
            5 != "5" // false

- strict inequality operator : !==

            5 !== 5 // false
            5 !== "5" // true

- when concatenating strings and numbers together, JS coerces the numbers to behave like strings

            ex : 365 + "days" = "365 days"
            ex : 1 + "2" // 12

- addition assignment operator : +=

            ex : 
            //count the number of overtime hours worked monday through friday
            var overtime = 1;
            overtime = +2;
            overtime = +1;
            overtime = +2;
            overtime = +3;
            console.log (overtime); // 9

- concatenation assignment operator : +=
  like addition assignment operator, but adds strings, not numbers
            var longString = "";
            longString += "Once ";
            longString += "upon ";
            longString += "a ";
            longString += "time ";
            longString += "... ";
            console.log(longString);
            // Once upon a time ...

_____________________________________________________________________

WRITING STATEMENTS 

- we make decisions based on whether certain conditions are true or false

- in JS there are conditional statements using if, and, but    

- the if statement executes a code if a condition is true
           
            if (condition == true) {
            //Execute code
            }

- you can use comparison operators to evaluate the expression (== , > , < , !=)

- the if else statement : if a condition is true, do something, if not, do something else
           
            if (condition == true) {
            //Execute code
            } else {
            //Execute code
            }

            ex : 
            a driving test
            a passing grade is greater than 40
            a failing grade is less than 40

            var result = 50;
            if (result > 40) {
            console.log("Congratulations you passed.");
            } else {
            console.log("Unfortunately you did not pass.");
            }
            
            ex : 
            var food = "hot";
            if (food == "hot") {
            console.log('Too hot');
            } else if (food == "cold") {
            console.log('Too cold');
            } else {
            console.log('Just right');
            }

_____________________________________________________________________

WORKING WITH CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS 

- else if and switch statements

            ex : 
            
            var place = 'first';

            if(place == 'first') {
            console.log('Gold');
            } else if (place == 'second') {
            console.log('Silver');
            } else if (place == 'third'){
            console.log('Bronze');
            } else {
            console.log('No medal');
            }
            
            //Output : Gold

- if you have to evaluate many other conditions, use the switch statement

            var place = 'first';

            switch(place) {
            case 'first':
                        console.log('Gold');
                        break;
            case 'second':
                        console.log('Silver');
                        break;
            case 'third':
                        console.log('Bronze);
                        break;
            default:
                        console.log('No medal');
            }

            //Output : Gold

_____________________________________________________________________

CONDITIONAL EXAMPLES

- flow control statements: if else and switch; they control the flow of execution of your code
  so that some code is skipped while other code is executed

- if and else if is best for a binary choice in the condition

- if, else if, and else can be used with a smaller number of possible outcomes you need to check

- when there are a lot of possible outcomes you ened to check, use the switch statement

_____________________________________________________________________

PRACTICE CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

- exercise : practice working with if else and switch statements

            var age = 10;
            if (age >= 65) {
                        console.log("You get your income from your pension");
            } else if (age <= 65 && age >= 18) {
                        console.log("Each month you get a salary.");
            } else if (age < 18) {
                        console.log ("You get an allowance.");
            } else {
                        console.log ("The value of the age variable is not numerical.");
            }
            
            var day = Sunday;
            
            switch(day) {
            case "Monday": 
                        console.log("Do something");
                        break;
            case "Tuesday":
                        console.log("Do something");
                        break;
            case "Wednesday":
                        console.log("Do something");
                        break;
            case "Thursday":
                        console.log("Do something");
                        break;
            case "Friday":
                        console.log("Do something");
                        break;
            case "Saturday":
                        console.log("Do something");
                        break;
            case "Sunday":
                        console.log("Do something");
                        break;
            default:
                        console.log("There is no such day");
            }

_____________________________________________________________________


LOOPING CONSTRUCTS


- looping in JS is used to execute repetitive tasks

- loops contain counter variables that count how many times a loop is fulfilled before it needs to reach a certain condition

            ex : 
            counting down from 10 to 1 before we say happy new year

            i is commonly used as a counter, it specifies where to start and stop counting

            use loops instead of console logging repeatedly 

                        for (var i = 1; i<101; i++) {
                        console.log(i);
                        } 

- types of loops : for, while, nested

- for loop : 
            
            syntax:
            for (initialization; condition; increment) {
            statement    
            }

  used to run a code a certain number of times
            
  set the value (ex : var i=0)
            
  specify the condition (ex: var i<3)

  increment the counter (ex: i++ or i--) 

- while loop :

            var i = 1;
            while (i < 4){
            console.log(i);
            i=i+1;
            }

  the start of the counter is set outside of the while loop
            
  the incrementing is done inside the loop's body

- nested loop : a loop inside of a loop

_____________________________________________________________________

FOR LOOP

- for loops automate code repetition
- loops through a block of code a number of times

- declaration, consisting of counter, named i for iterator :
  the counter's start value must be assigned
  there must be an end count value, which specifies how many times the loop must run until loop ends
  there must be an incrementor, which increases (i++) or decreases(i--) the value of i by 1 each time the code runs

- loop body :
  enclosed in curly braces
  specifies what code should do once exit condition is met

            ex : 
           
            for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
              console.log(i);
            }
            console.log('Go')
           
            i = 1: the count starts at 1
            i <=3: the count includes all values equal to or less than 3
            i++: the count increments by 1

            output :
            1
            2
            3
            Go

            ex : for (var i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
              console.log(i)
            }
            console.log('Happy New Year!')

            starting at 10 and ending at 1, counting down by incrememnts of 1
            after 1, "Happy New Year!"

            output : 
            10
            9
            8
            7 
            6
            5
            4
            3
            2
            1
            Happy New Year!

_____________________________________________________________________

WHILE LOOP

- code that repeats as long as a specified condition is true

- counter value is set before the loop and must be clearly defined
  this value is the value at which the counter starts counting

            ex: var counter = 3 or var i = 3

- only need to specify exit condition in parentheses of loop declaration
  this which gives JS an expression to check
  if this expression returns true, JS will run the code inside the while loop
  when this expression becomes false, loop stops

            ex : 

            var i = 5;
            while (counter > 0) {
              console.log(counter);
              counter = counter - 1;
            }
            console.log('Happy New Year!')

                        OR

            var i = 5;
            while (i > 0) {
            console.log(i);
            i--;
            }
            console.log('Happy New Year!')

_____________________________________________________________________

NESTED LOOPS

- used to perform more than one task at the same time

            ex:    

            for (i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
              for (j = 1; j <=7; j++) {
                console.log("Week" + i + " day " + j);
              }
            }

            ex:
            
            create a two-week plan for Monday through Fridays
            5 days for week 1, 5 days for week 2

            Week 1- day 1
            Week 1- day 2
            Week 1-day 3
            etc.

            outer loop loops over the weeks,
            inner loop loops over the days:

            for (var i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
              for (var j = 1; j<=5; j++) {
              }
            }

            ex: 
            for (var year = 2023; var < 2025; year++) {
              console.log(year);
                for (var month = 6; var < 9; month++) {
                  console.log("--------", month);
                }
              }
- be careful not to nest too many loops, as this slows down code

- use i and j variable names

USES OF LOOPS

exercise : you are making cards for children letter blocks A through G to be presented on a kid's toy store website

            var cubes = 'ABCDEFG';
            for (i = 0; i < cubes.length; i++) {
              var styles = "font-size: 40px; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid blue; background: pink; color: purple";
              console.log("%c", cubes[i], styles)
            }

%c : converts an argument as css
i = 0 : i starts off at A or 0 
i < cubes.length : cubes.length is the total length of the string var cubes, which is ABCDEFG; i must be less than the total length of the string for code to run
cubes[i] : targets a specific letter in the ABCDEFG string; i = 0 is A

TERNARY OPERATOR (MDN)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals#ternary_operator

tests a condition and returns one value if it is true, one value if it is false
syntax: 
            condition ? run this code : run this code instead;

ex:
            const greeting = isBirthday
            ? "Happy birthday!"
            : "Good morning!";
