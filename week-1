Jane's list:
buy groceries
  obtain data from product barcodes
  collate financial info; cash register data
track heart rate during exercise :
  smartwatch tracks heartbeat; is synced to social fitness app
buy flowers :
  orders flowers online

all of these tasks involves computer programs
computer program--a series of instructions that tell a 
computer what to do in specific circumstances and perform a task

programming language--used to control computer programs; a bridge that facilitates communication between computers and people

for a computer to understand programming language, it needs to be stored in RAM--random access memory on a disk in binary code---representation of machine language in 0s and 1s; these 0s and 1s represent electric switches 

a computer's CPU--central processing unit--can comprehend binary and update itself accordingly

low level languages--closer to being understood by a computer's CPU
high level languages--ex: javascript languages that must be converted to binary code so that a CPU can work with them

"Why Javascript"

javascript makes interactivity possible, it builds interactivity into webpages, every website uses it, can be used for front-end and back-end development

ex of uses : interactive maps

the only computer language that allows direct interaction with webpages dynamically on the client-side

it's popularity is back to the rules of backwards compatiblity--all websites built in the past still need to work today--without JavaScript much of the Internet becomes useless

ease-of-use: JavaScript has built-in tools, every browser has a built in Javascript engine 

used widely: Javascript is used in almost every website; used as plain JavaSCript, in JavaScript Frameworks (ex: React), and used by servers Node.js

accessible and comes with a web development community, good for new developers

careers: JavaScript skills are high in demand
