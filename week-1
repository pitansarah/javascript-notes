"INTRODUCTION TO PROGRAMMING"

Learn: 
role of programming,
instructions via a programming language, &
role of javascript.

computer program--a series of instructions that tell a computer what to do in specific circumstances and perform a task

programming language--used to control computer programs; a bridge that facilitates communication between computers and people

for a computer to understand programming language, it needs to be stored in RAM--random access memory on a disk in 
binary code---representation of machine language in 0s and 1s; these 0s and 1s represent electric switches 

a computer's CPU--central processing unit--can comprehend binary and update itself accordingly

low level languages--closer to being understood by a computer's CPU

high level languages--ex: javascript languages that must be converted to binary code so that a CPU can work with them
ex: Javascript

"WHY JAVASCRIPT"

javascript makes interactivity possible, can be used for front-end and back-end development

javascript is the only computer language that allows direct interaction with webpages dynamically on the client-side

backwards compatiblity--all websites built in the past still need to work today--without JavaScript much of the Internet becomes useless

its ease-of-use: JavaScript has built-in tools, every browser has a built in Javascript engine 

it's used widely: Javascript is used in almost every website; used as plain JavaSCript, in JavaScript Frameworks (ex: React), and used by servers Node.js

its accessible and comes with a web development community, good for new developers

careers: JavaScript skills are high in demand

"PROGRAMMING IN JAVASCRIPT"

browser vendors -- companies that build browsers, popular ca. early 2000s
with these different browsers came different discrepancies between other browsers
developers had to write separate code for separate browsers, which led to compatibility issues
several projects tried to solve these compatibility issues 

jquery solved this problem
jquery--library that users could import to write code, this code worked across all browsers

React (2011) solved many issues in creating, updating, and maintaining complex websites

legacy code--old code found on the web, ex: jquery code you come across in an actively running project

"WRITING YOUR FIRST JAVASCRIPT CODE"

comments, 2 types:

single-line: //this is a single-line comment

multi-line: 
/*this
is
a
multi-line
comment
*/
& 
/*this is a multi-line comment on a single line */

semi-colon ;
used to clearly delimit parts of code from other parts of code
ASI (automatic semi-colon insertion) usually takes care of this for you

using developer tools in browser
how to access developer tools : right click, click inspect
you can type JS command into Devtools console section
if you need multiple lines of code before you run them, press shift + enter to get onto the next line

console.log ("Hello, World")
output: Hello, World

console.log("%cHello, World", "color: blue; font-size: 40px")
output: Hello, World (stylized in blue with a font size of 40px)

format :
console.log("%c...", "...")
            text   ,  style

concatenation operator-- + , a plus symbol used to join pieces of text, or execute addition between numbers

console.log("Hello " + "there, " + "World")
is the same as
console.log("Hello ", "there, ", "World")

commas are included after quotation marks
_____________________________________________________________________

"VARIABLES"

underlying structure that allows you to write JavaScript

learning:
variable declaration
variable assignment
reassigning variable values

by using a variable, you can save the name in the variable and reuse it in the future

"name" : enters a name

variable declaration:
var person;
include semicolon after declaration

create a person variable with an assignment operator, = :
var person = "John"

check variable:
person;
output >John

Use JS to output "Hello John" automatically:
console.log("Hello", person);
>Hello, John
inside parentheses, insert one or more values separated by commas

create a greeting variable
var greeting = "Hello"

console.log(greeting, person)
>Hello John

variable declaration :
var ... = "..."

why variables are useful:
they can be reassigned with different values
the same code can be used to get different results

single quotes can also be used inside parentheses 
however double quotes are used when including items in single quotes
a concatenation symbol can also be used :
ex: console.log ("My pet dog's name is:" + petDog)

DATA TYPES 

coding efficiently involves knowing when to use different data types

data--the values or information within an app

7 primitive data types:
string
number
boolean
null
undefined
bigint
symbol

strings and numbers:
names and descriptions are text values, or string data types
prices are numerical values, or number data type

different rules apply to making a string of numbers or texts 

numbers:
//numbers
375

strings:
//string
"Hello World"

number data types has a limited range of values
string data types have an unlimited range of values

boolean:
2 values: true and false
useful for making decisions

null:
1 value, null, representing absence of value

undefined:
1 value, undefined, represents a variable not yet assigned a value

bigint:
big integer
a data type that accomadates a greater range of numbers than the number data type

symbol:
a data type used as a unique identifier

OPERATORS

operators are used to perform operations on variables an dvalues
operators are used to manipulate individual data items and return a result

ex: assignment operator, =

learn about:
assignment operators : arithmetic, comparison
logical operators

arithmetic operators : 
addition, +
subtraction, -
division /
multiplication *

comparison operators:
compares and returns a logical value based on whether comparison is true
greater than, >
less than, <
equal to, == (single = is used for assignment operator)
not equal to, !=

logical operators:
used to determine whether something is true or false

and operator, && : checks for both conditions to be true
ex : a>5 && a<10

or operator, || : checks for at least one condition to be true
ex : a>5 || a>10

not operator, ! : returns false if the result is true
ex : !(a>5) 

operators are used to control the flow of a program

console.log (2+2);
> 4

console.log (2<3);
> true

console.log (2>3);
> false

console.log (10==10);
> true
