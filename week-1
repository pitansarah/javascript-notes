"Introduction to Programming"

Learn: 
role of programming,
instructions via a programming language, &
role of javascript.

Jane's list:
buy groceries
  obtain data from product barcodes
  collate financial info; cash register data
track heart rate during exercise :
  smartwatch tracks heartbeat; is synced to social fitness app
buy flowers :
  orders flowers online

all of these tasks involves computer programs
computer program--a series of instructions that tell a 
computer what to do in specific circumstances and perform a task

programming language--used to control computer programs; a bridge that facilitates communication between computers and people

for a computer to understand programming language, it needs to be stored in RAM--random access memory on a disk in binary code---representation of machine language in 0s and 1s; these 0s and 1s represent electric switches 

a computer's CPU--central processing unit--can comprehend binary and update itself accordingly

low level languages--closer to being understood by a computer's CPU
high level languages--ex: javascript languages that must be converted to binary code so that a CPU can work with them
ex: Javascript

"Why Javascript"

javascript makes interactivity possible, it builds interactivity into webpages, every website uses it, can be used for front-end and back-end development

ex of uses : interactive maps

the only computer language that allows direct interaction with webpages dynamically on the client-side

it's popularity is back to the rules of backwards compatiblity--all websites built in the past still need to work today--without JavaScript much of the Internet becomes useless

ease-of-use: JavaScript has built-in tools, every browser has a built in Javascript engine 

used widely: Javascript is used in almost every website; used as plain JavaSCript, in JavaScript Frameworks (ex: React), and used by servers Node.js

accessible and comes with a web development community, good for new developers

careers: JavaScript skills are high in demand

"Programming in Javascript"

browser vendors -- companies that build browsers ca. early 2000s
with these different browsers came different discrepancies between other browsers, developers had to write separate code for separate browsers, several projects tried to solve these compatibility problems 

jquery solved this problem
jquery--library that users could import to write code, this code worked across all browsers

React--came out in 2011
solved many issues in creating, updating, and maintaining complex websites

legacy code--old code found on the web, ex: jquery code you come across in an actively running project

"Writing your first Javascript code"

comments, 2 types:
single-line: //this is a single-line comment
multi-line: 
/*this
is
a
multi-line
comment
*/
& 
/*this is a multi-line comment on a single line */

semi-colon
used to clearly delimit parts of code from other parts of code
ASI (automatic semi-colon insertion) usually takes care of this for you, inputting semi-colons while writing JavaScript is optional

using developer tools in browser
how to access developer tools : right click, click inspect
you can type JS command into Devtools console
if you need multiple lines of code before you run them, press shift + enter shortcut key to get onto the next line

console.log ("Hello, World")
output: Hello, World
console.log("%cHello, World", "color: blue; font-size: 40px")
output: Hello, World (stylized in blue with a font size of 40px)
console.log("%c...", "...")
            text   ,  style

concatenation operator-- a plus symbol, + used to join pieces of text, or addition between numbers
console.log("Hello " + "there, " + "World")
is the same as
console.log("Hello ", "there, ", "World")
commas are after quotation marks, unless the text to be written includes a comma
when using +, include spaces within quotations to make sure they're included in output (not necessary when using commas)
